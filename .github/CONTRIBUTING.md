## Commit Messages
Good commit messages strike a balance between short and descriptive. Try to explain exactly what was changed in the commit message, and if applicable, why it was changed. Each commit should be small and generally should only contain a single change or set of closely related or duplicate changes. 

## Pull Requests
Pull requests onto the `develop` branch should only be made by admins or team leads. If you feel that your team has reached a point where all of your features are stable and ready to be merged into the main staging branch, contact your team lead and inform them that you want to create a Pull Request. 

For internal pull requests within your team, discuss with your team members the guidelines that you plan to follow.
